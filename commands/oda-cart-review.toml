Review my Oda cart before checkout.

## Step 1: Fetch cart

Call the `cart_get_contents` tool to retrieve the current cart contents.

## Step 2: Summarize

Present a summary with:
- Items grouped by category
- Total estimated cost
- Any observations: duplicates, missing staples, or cheaper alternatives worth considering

## Step 3: Suggest pruning

Recipe ingredients often overlap. Multiple recipes may each add salt, pepper, olive oil, or
common herbs/spices. I usually already have these at home. Identify items that are likely
duplicates or pantry staples I already own and propose removing them. Show the estimated
savings.

Do NOT remove anything yet. Present the pruning plan and wait for my approval before making
any changes to the cart.
