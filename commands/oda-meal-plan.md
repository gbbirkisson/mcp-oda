description: Plan meals for the week

Help me plan meals for the week using Oda recipes.

If you have a means of storing memories across sessions, start by checking for any previously
stored dietary preferences, dislikes, and past meal plans. Use this information to pre-fill
known restrictions and to avoid suggesting meals that were picked recently.

First ask how many people I'm cooking for and if I have any dietary restrictions or specific
preferences (e.g., vegetarian, no fish, quick meals). Mention any preferences you found in
memory so I can confirm or update them.

Then search for recipes, suggest a diverse meal plan (varying main ingredients, cuisines, and
cooking styles), and let me pick which ones I want. Avoid repeating meals from recent plans
stored in memory.

Once I've decided, add the selected recipes to my cart with the correct number of portions.

After confirming the final plan, save any new preferences or dislikes that surfaced during the
conversation and record which meals were chosen so future plans stay diverse. Save this in
`MEAL_PLAN.md` and make it structured so its easily available. Now also make sure to read this
file now and see if some things have already been added in there.

Finally, run the `/oda-cart-review` command to review the cart.
